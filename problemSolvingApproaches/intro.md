what steps to make something solvable ?

steps to take & things to make it easier!
this section is on thought, next section is on code

*OBJECTIVES*
>define what an algo is 
>devise plan to solve algos
>compare constrast prob solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

*WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?*
>a process or set of steps to accomplis a certain task!

*why do you need to know?*
everything in programming uses algorighms. its the foundation to being a successful problem solving developer
++ INTERVIEWS

*HOW TO IMPROVE*
1. DEVISE A PLAN FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS
2. master common problem solving patterns

*PROBLEM SOLVING STRATS*
>understand the priblem
>explore concrete examples
>break it down
>solve/simplify
>look back and refactor

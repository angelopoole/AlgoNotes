***UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM***
// many of these strats are adapted from George polya's book ?how to solve it? which is a great resource for anyone who wants to be a better problem solver

1. can i restate the problem in my own words
2. what are the inputs that go into the problem
3. what are the outputs that should come from the soulution of the problem
4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? in other words do i have enough info to solve the problem? 
5. how should i lable the important peives of data that are a part of the problem?

ex _= WRITE A FUNC WHICH TAKES TWO NUMBERS AND RETURNS THEIR SUM =_
  
  1. can i restate the problem?
  >  implement addition
  2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? 
  >ints?
  >floats?
  >what about string for large numbers?
  3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution?
  > int? float? string?
  4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? do i have enough info?
  
  7. how should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

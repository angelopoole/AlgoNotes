### ABSTRACT VS DATA STRUCTURE

abstract data type : abstraction of data structure which probifdes only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

Examples of abstract and imlpimentations

| abstract | implementation                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List     | dynamic array, linked list                                    |
| Queue    | linked list based Queue, array based Queue, Stack based Queue |
| Map      | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table                               |
| Vehicle  | GolfCart, Bicycle, SmartCar                                   |

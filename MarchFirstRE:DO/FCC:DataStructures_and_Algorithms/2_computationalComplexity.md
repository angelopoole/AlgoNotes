### Computational complexity

Questions to ask youself while developing

How much time does this algorithm need to finish?  
How much space dies this algorithm need for computation?

##### Big o notation

Big-O only cares about the worst case, helping to quantify preformance oas an input size becomes arbitrarily large.

Constant Time: O(1)  
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))  
Linear Time: O(n)  
linerarithmic Time: O(nlog(n))  
Quadric Time: O(n^2)  
Cubic Time: O(n^3)  
Exponential Time: O(b^n), B > 1  
Factorial Time: O(n!)

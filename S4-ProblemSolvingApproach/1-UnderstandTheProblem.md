# understanding the problem ->

Here are some patterns you can follow/ask yourself while solving algorithm problems.

1. can you restate the problem in your own words?
2. what are the inputs to the problem
3. What are the outputs to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined by the inputs? Do we have enough info to solve the question?
5. How should I label the important peices of data that are a part of the problem?

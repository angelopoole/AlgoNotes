# Step three: Break it Down! ->

1. Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

Q: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string
We only care about alphanumeric characters

_type out a skeleton of the function_

```
function charCount(str){
  // do something
  //return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; values should be the counts for those characters!
}

function charCount(str){
  // make object to return at end
  // loop over string, for each character...
     // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in our object, add one to count
    //if the char is a number/letter AND not in our object,add to object and set the valur to one
    //if the character is something else {space, period, etc} dont do anything
 // return object at end
}
```

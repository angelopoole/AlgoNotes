# Objectives!

- Define what an algo is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and constrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conqer

_This is made up of two key aspects:_

1. devise a pattern for solving problems
2. master common problem solving problems

**problem solving ->**
Section 4 will go over these concepts:

- understand the problem
- explore concrete examples
- break it down
- solve/simplify
- Look back and refactor

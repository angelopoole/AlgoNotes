Objectives!

- Define what an algo is
- devise a plan to solve algorithms
- compare and constrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conqer

This is made up of two key aspects:

1. devise a pattern for solving problems
2. master common problem solving problems

**problem solving ->**

- understand the problem
- explore concrete examples
- break it down
- solve/simplify
- Look back and refactor

BIG 0 OF OBJECTS ->

big o of objects,

insertion -> O(1)
removal -> O(1)
searchibng -> O(N)
access -> O(1)

Big O of Object methods

Object.keys - O(N)
Object.Values - O(N)
Object.entries - O(N)
hasOwnProperty - O(1)

_when you dont need any ordering, objects are a great choice!_
_object methods above with O(N) complexity produce arrays, this is why they're complexity is higher, the time taken increases with the length of the outputted array!_

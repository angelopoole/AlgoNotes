what steps to make something solvable ?

steps to take & things to make it easier!
this section is on thought, next section is on code

_OBJECTIVES_

> define what an algo is
> devise plan to solve algos
> compare constrast prob solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

_WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?_

> a process or set of steps to accomplis a certain task!

_why do you need to know?_
everything in programming uses algorighms. its the foundation to being a successful problem solving developer
++ INTERVIEWS

_HOW TO IMPROVE_

1. DEVISE A PLAN FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS
2. master common problem solving patterns

_PROBLEM SOLVING STRATS_

> understand the priblem
> explore concrete examples
> break it down
> solve/simplify
> look back and refactor
